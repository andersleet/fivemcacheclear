## This is a batch file to simplify clearing the FiveM custom GTA server cache folder.

By default, FiveM installs to ```%localappdata%\FiveM\FiveM.app\```.

As far as I know, there is no way to adjust this when FiveM is installed. However, it is safe to change the ```%backup%``` folder location. By default it is in the same folder that ```%localappdata%\FiveM\FiveM.app\data``` exists in.
